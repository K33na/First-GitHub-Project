# First GitHub Project

This is my very first web project using HTML and CSS!  
It's a simple page that helps me practice basic web structure, GitHub, Git commands, commits, folder structure, and repo organization.

## Files Included

- `index.html` — the main HTML file.
- `styles.css` — the stylesheet for styling the web page.

## Structure

|____exercise-1-basic-page/

|____index.html

|____styles.css

## Goals

- Practice Git and GitHub.
- Practice basic HTML and CSS structure.
- Build a  strong coding foundation.
